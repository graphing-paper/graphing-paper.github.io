INTERVIEW WITH A FAMOUS CELEBRITY IN HIS OLD AGE<br><br>

Do you miss being alive? <br>
I do not think all people are holy. <br><br>
I hate you. <br>
Of course I have a favorite tree. <br><br>
Do you remember leaded gasoline? <br>
There is no such thing as war. <br><br>
We are all one. <br>

I appreciated outward appearance of harmony, current of entitlement in the way of bodies, relationships, and sexualization. <br>

“who is that boy?” I ask ToMary, gesturing to a creature in the soy field, long and pale, hands shaking, raised to the sun.  <br>
“Are you a hired hand?” she asks, without turning to me, “A psychology major twenty bucks an hour sipping tea in front of your glowing screen?” <br>
“I am, by the grace of god.” <br>
ToMary squints into the sun. “I’ve never seen him before. In the country to get sane.” <br>
“I’m sure the pesticides will do him a lot of good.” <br>
“You never know. The mind is mysterious” <br>

     The killer whale boatside rams it's head into the stern. Blood cracks flakes of plastic. There is no song. We are in the wildfire smoke suspended by string, beyond us only void endlessly white endlessly bright. Miles of it and the landing gear go down and all you can see is smoke. Sun at the north half out. <br>

    The woman across the aisle is winding thread. She's embroidering a bag, a truly fantastic thing with stars going all the way down, branched trees, and a big sun with a snake in it. I embroider too, but not nearly as well, my stitches large and awkward, those of an unpracticed child. <br>
Her work is mesmerizing, twisting strands of gold into the fabric of the bag, spirals from the core of the snake. I drew a spiral on my wall. It was for defense reasons. Not that i believe in that. Or whatever. She wears a bright orange zip up coat, nearly florescent. She pricks her finger and jumps as the blood spreads through the fabric of the bag. <br>

jack<br>
daniels into a water bottle <br>
and hides it under his shirt when we walk in. He drives a shiny white car, low<br>
to the ground with really tinted windows. I thought it looked like a drug dealer’s car and when I told him<br>
this he got upset. I drink too much Jack Daniels and the final scene of the film gives me a <br>
panic<br>
 attack.<br><br>
