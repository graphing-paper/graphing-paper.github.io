     The killer whale boatside rams it's head into the stern. Blood cracks flakes of plastic. There is no song. We are in the wildfire smoke suspended by string, beyond us only void endlessly white endlessly bright. Miles of it and the landing gear go down and all you can see is smoke. Sun at the north half out. <br>
"Normal? Not this time of year" someone says. <br>

    The woman across the aisle is winding thread. She's embroidering a bag, a truly fantastic thing with stars going all the way down, branched trees, and a big sun with a snake in it. I embroider too, but not nearly as well, my stitches large and awkward, those of an unpracticed child. <br>
Her work is mesmerizing, twisting strands of gold into the fabric of the bag, spirals from the core of the snake. I drew a spiral on my wall. It was for defense reasons. Not that i believe in that. Or whatever. She wears a bright orange zip up coat, nearly florescent. She pricks her finger and jumps as the blood spreads through the fabric of the bag. <br>

      TED KACYNSKI POEM (originally from character workshop class last week. edited later)<br><br>
      
    When I was a – a kid<br>
, all the movies I saw were on VHS, things my parents liked. Joe vs Volcano, Beaches, Princess Bride.<br>
peace and love, BABY<br>
hair black when I was a freshman in collage<br>
wanted to be uma therman, smoking cigarettes and<br>
I HAVE DOEN TONS OF DRUGS WITH YOU AND KEPT YOU ALIVE FOREVER!!!!” this my memorial 2<br>
TED KACYNSKI <br>
attaching a ifesto turned into a apocalypse prepper and built a compost bin in the yard without asking
me. He dropped out of school to do who knows what and then I had to H. at a freak. Fuck that guy. Fuck
Ted Kaczynski too.<br><br>

      

my hair get oily- slicked it back,. Women wouldn’t sleep with me<br>
though. Only men at parties, drunk and ag <br>
 second dates they <br>
brought me bottles of jack daniels on top of the fridge. nice to be wanted.<br><br>

jack<br>
daniels into a water bottle <br>
and hides it under his shirt when we walk in. He drives a shiny white car, low<br>
to the ground with really tinted windows. I thought it looked like a drug dealer’s car and when I told him<br>
this he got upset. I drink too much Jack Daniels and the final scene of the film gives me a <br>
panic<br>
 attack.<br><br>

      
      
 weird look, hair black. I go to a seedy motel<br>
 with a coworker. I<br>
see more movies with my new roommate until I scream at him <br>
media depictions of what a “cool” person should be, <br>
and the doubts she <br>

 rusting out all that drought. <br>
child in the backseat of the truck, <br>

  hobble to the crash. Blood and glass cover the road, the overturned truck.<br>
