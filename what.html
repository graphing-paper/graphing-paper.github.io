Caught in sharks and minnows <br>
Your dog mouth dripping adipose. <br>
Blood, stomach dreams. <br>
At least I’m real(ish) <br>
Not plastic(ish)- <br>
Blast away the original mind <br>
And leave behind a mailman <br>
Steady, union work <br>
Good health insurance<br>
A house with wall around the back <br>
And a long driveway <br><br>

Am I happy, <br>
hanging on a clothes’ line, <br>
fording the river to salvation? <br>
the cards say<br>
“don’t worry, <br>
It’s for some other time.” <br><br>

Disaster is real<br>
Disaster is inevitable<br>
Called to the hospital<br>
The only thing you know<br>

You don’t understand me<br>
No one understands me <br>
And she’s right. <br>
I don’t understand her. <br>
I won’t understand her until much, much later<br>
With a book and a sunburn, somewhere in Miami<br>
With a mouth full of brittlebush and a nose full of night sky<br>
Flooring a borrowed BMW<br><br>

Let’s race<br>
Says a crew cut convertible, <br>
Hissing, spitting at the red light. <br>
Three, <br>
Two, <br>
Patchwork forgiveness <br>
Soap in our mouths<br>
Gritting our teeth for the yellow sound of streetlamps<br>
Imagining our bodies wrapped around eighty mile ecstasy <br><br>

He pulls ahead and I take my foot off the gas<br>
alone in the dark<br>
Hours, days<br>
lie here<br>
thinking now<br>
how easy it was<br>
falling out of love<br><br>

realization in the nuclear oh my god how could this happen here <br>
that inevitability- cancer- drifting onto our skin <br>
November snow <br>
Cold and eyes and hands<br>
When she kissed me I tasted iodine <br><br>

I pulled over when I saw the glass on the road <br>
The police lights<br>
Blood on the mangled corpse of modernity<br>
Look-<br>
the nervous man photographs the arrangement of corpses<br>
swallowing hard<br>
looking away<br>
focusing on the yellow<br>
focusing on the black<br><br>

they stack us, one on top of the other<br>
with the other teenage mistakes<br>
bleaching us<br>
tearing us <br>
melting us into each other <br>

<p>
You smell like my air conditioner <br>
Tin skin of all those renters <br>
All those prayer flags <br>
Mirrored two in one <br>
When our ears unplug  <br>

I can’t see you without shaking <br>
Dream-walking in your glass city <br>
Letting my hair slick sweat and PFAS fires<br>
Bleeding youth and mechanical wives<br>

On a business call in the bathroom<br>
And in the circle of concrete boxes, <br>
And in the cigarette butts<br>
And in the morgue freezer<br>

I parked on the lines<br>
And took the bus to the other side of town <br>
Because<br>
Because <br>
Because I want to forget your name<br>

Words of a woman evangelical preacher, now married to a prominent scam artist serving 4 years in state prison<br>
I dressed in black and sang hymns and held a crying woman’s hands in the kid’s Sunday school chairs where in the beginning god created paper plate skies and paper plate land and paper plate creatures of the sea. I held my arms out over the great steel pulley and the great stitched up formaldehyde lips. It was  white roses and O God, by your mercy bless this grave and send your holy angel to watch over it. <br>

EARLY AFTERNOON THOUGHTS <br>
I think I’m playing a character, one I’ve already created, short shorts and a dolly Parton wig, talking about getting impaled by the door opener. I try to go to an experimental art show in someone’s house but when I get to the building a cat gives me a weird look so I spin on my heel and walk back home. I think it’s a boring story, really. That’s the heart of it. All I care about is the land and the freeway. I don’t care about the car or the horses or the faggot boyfriend. I care about death mostly, but-<br>
He’s jaywalking, basketball shorts, backpack, bleach blonde crew cut, tattoo of a celebrity wife with her face rounded around the back of his calf muscle. She’s inside a bowling alley, on a zoom call, fading pale thin lips like a chevy fleetside; one-oh-ten chorme with a parking from last year crinkled on the window. Strike, all thirty screens proclaim-<br>
I love the US military. I can’t help it. It’s evil because it’s a military it’s full of people who have no choice but to think they are helping save the world. Offer your body, offer your mind. They will pay you a white picket camero and tell you it’s the right thing. You get a little cash, you a wife and a moral martyrdom. God bless the-<br>
I haven’t finished anything I set out to do today. I never finish anything I set out to do. I’m hungry, haven’t eaten anything in a week besides sex dreams and red kratom. Now im craving grease, yellow advertisements and diner fries-<br>
There’s an article about Ozempec in the Washington post. I get a thrill, something embodied, thinking about injecting myself with it. There’s something really wrong with me, a craving for Ozempic submission, sacrificing of the natural order of the flesh to medical devastation. I want to be held down, I want to be shot up. Controlled, molded medical Pygmalion, forced into snake stardom.  I want to be bones and naught else, withering 4 u-<br>

It is the 6am procession of our bodies, Carrie fisher clean, tight braids and running shoes beating down the twilight, brilliant disciplined minds of us future MD JD CIA specialists. And there are those of us coming down from LSD or Adderall, gaunt ghosts wandering aimlessly down the middle of the road and sitting in people’s front yards, still half-hallucinating self-sabotage world peace poetry. There are the tight-wound cops and kidnappers, looking though binoculars at McDonald’s coffee, classic rock, and cast iron aquariums. We are going, we are coming, we are waiting. <br>
Don’t go out at the end of the month, don’t spray paint walls or talk to addicts. The cops have quotas to meet, so leave your Monday mornings out of this <br>

“who is that boy?” I ask ToMary, gesturing to a creature in the soy field, long and pale, hands shaking, raised to the sun.  <br>
“Are you a hired hand?” she asks, without turning to me, “A psychology major twenty bucks an hour sipping tea in front of your glowing screen?” <br>
“I am, by the grace of god.” <br>
ToMary squints into the sun. “I’ve never seen him before. In the country to get sane.” <br>
“I’m sure the pesticides will do him a lot of good.” <br>
“You never know. The mind is mysterious” <br>

Sun at the north half out. <br>

    The woman across the aisle is winding thread. She's embroidering a bag, a truly fantastic thing with stars going all the way down, branched trees, and a big sun with a snake in it. I embroider too, but not nearly as well, my stitches large and awkward, those of an unpracticed child. <br>
Her work is mesmerizing, twisting strands of gold into the fabric of the bag, spirals from the core of the snake. I drew a spiral on my wall. It was for defense reasons. Not that i believe in that. Or whatever. She wears a bright orange zip up coat, nearly florescent. She pricks her finger and jumps as the blood spreads through the fabric of the bag. <br>

gas down as far as it will go, roaring sketched into the land,<br>
 rusting out all that drought. <br>
