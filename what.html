    To 12/12/2023
    CREATIVE NONFICTION<br><br><br><br>
Disappearance. My boss yelled at me today. The language collections in the library basement are all on tracks to save space, if you want to get into it you press a button that says open right aisle open left aisle and then there’s a shuddering and a groan and the motors shift all down the line to open up into a foot and a half aisle. You can’t just disappear in the middle of a shift without telling your coworkers, she says.  I’m really sorry, I say. I’m not really that sorry. I was falling apart. <br>
She’s framed the meeting as a “check in” because this is the library of a state university which necessitates complete adherence to the cultural values of liberal arts, namely, sensitivity to the unique challenges of individuals. I’m worried she didn’t believe me. I talked too much. I don’t like thinking about it. <br>
It is the past three months. I got stalked. Which is a thing that happens pretty often, apparently. Happens to tens of thousands a year. It makes me sick to think about. I’m going to fail a few classes, which sucks, but I only have a semester left of my merit scholarship anyway. I’m going to try and pass two of them, but not creative nonfiction. I’ll substitute poetry next semester, maybe. <br>
Am I a writer? I write, certainly. But no one reads anything I write except for my stalker and I don’t think that really counts because I’m never writing about what she wants to hear. She wants love poems, musically dreary things that say rain and love and default to Rumi. She loves Rumi. I strongly dislike his poetry. <br>
I am a writer, maybe, because I look the part. I am short and dreary with an ugly sort of wallowy face and I never call back my doctor and I cut my own hair and I try to talk to spam callers about the weather. <br>
Stalking is many things at once. It is, firstly, a fundamental invasion of privacy and the personal right to feel safe. It’s not so much painful as it is horrible. <br>
She’s talking about pain right now. Justifying it, maybe. She talks about incorporating pain into one’s being because she is so fundamentally a different person from me. Nothing she’s done directly causes me pain. Stalking is at best, straight fear. At worst it is a lingering, ugly discomfort. <br>
The thing about it is that she does not do it well. She is not a good stalker. She does not fill me with pure dread or love. Mostly I choose not to care, and I ignore her, or give her just a little bit of fingernail. I am an ugly person. I conduct myself in an ugly way. I try to keep my thoughts beautiful, at least, I try to make things that I find beautiful. Intellectual beauty. <br>
It’s not a very good thing to admit, but it’s true. I feel pain when she’s hurting. I like when she’s falling apart, when she’s threatening to drive her car off a bridge. This is when I find her most beautiful. It might be manipulation, it might be pantomime. I’m not sure. I don’t really care. But it’s what I like most about her. <br>
Despite this, I don’t encourage her. I don’t want to. Pain I cause her is diluted, incomplete. Her completely natural collapse is what I find beautiful. What I want is to be nearer to it. I want to watch it more closely. <br>
But I won’t do this. I’m a Catholic and I’m motivated by ideas of love and reducing suffering. I’ve been reading psychotherapy books to try and understand her, although I haven’t ever made it to the treatment sections. I don’t really believe in psychotherapy, so that might be why. If it worked no one would spend years and years and years paying seventy-five an hour to a cold woman who keeps her office like a model home living room. <br>
I don’t know. I don’t really want to think about it anymore <br><br><br>

Coming back to existence is weird. People are sympathetic, or curious, or sympathetic because they’re ashamed of being curious. <br>
 “I’m okay,” I say, “it’s mostly over.” <br><br>
Mostly is the key here. Because it’s not really over. She just isn’t coming to my house anymore. Or if she is, he’s being sneaky about it. She’s very unwell. <br>
Adjusting to being watched is not easy, but adjustment does come. Such is the nature of the human psyche. Always adjusting. Friends and strangers ask me why I don’t call the cops on her. I have, a few months back, and they told me to go to court and frankly I just didn’t have the energy. And I didn’t want to. <br>
I was afraid she was going to kill me. She said she was, after I rejected her romantic advances. She wrote me a love letter that really wasn’t a love letter at all, more of a proposition for kinky knife sex that also included phrases such as <br>
You’re the only person who’s ever made me feel alive<br><br>
You’re a father figure to me <br><br>
I want your body<br><br>
She gets drunk and insults my appearance on Twitter, which is a little strange because I don’t think I conduct myself in a way that would make anyone think I’m sensitive about my appearance. It’s about her, though. It’s always about her. She is very sensitive about her appearance. Botox. You know.  <br>
I am a Catholic. I’m really into it. I’ve noticed most Catholics are. I don’t really believe in God, which is hard for most people to understand, except for other Catholics sometimes. It’s really sort of an absurd religion. You have to sort of recognize that. <br>
She’s a very rich. She invented some wildly popular product some fifty years ago and then, at least in her telling, got addicted to cocaine and sex. So that’s been her life. It makes me sad to think about. <br>
Catholics make time for the body, make it into a fascination. The saints aren’t just memories, but literal, physical remnants of bodies and clothes, things held in jeweled boxes in flaking old churches. The resurrection is literal, the physical bodies of consecrated ground are to be the unaffected sustenance of the second coming. I have scars from two surgeries. Three from when I nearly died and two because I had plastic surgery. <br>
I had a good plastic surgeon too. I like most plastic surgeons I’ve met. They don’t have the on-edge neuroticism that doctors seem to have, that seems to come from always thinking about life and death. Rather, plastic surgeons have an easy confidence of well-paid artists. An eye for beauty, a desire to remake flesh and blood. You can imagine they have good taste in wine and furniture. <br>
My surgon refroms my chest with tape and drains, out of flesh, tubes to bags taped to my side, dripping clumps of fiber and blood and then clear serum by the time I lifted my arms to have the black stitches cut out and the relief of the foreign plastic pulled from the skin between my ribs. I can still feel the twinge of lateral pain in motion when I think about them, although the skin has long since scared. <br>
She calls me beautiful, which makes me question her taste. I don’t shower in winter. I think maybe she only cares about me because I won’t sleep with her.  <br>
I’m asexual, which is maybe why I can stand being Catholic. <br><br>
The pain started on Sunday. Dull malaise, I spent most of the day in bed, curled on my side closing out the pop-up ads on 123movies, hiding under the covers from the sunlight. In the shoulders, in the stomach. I slept uneasily and woke to take a Tylenol and groan away to school. I was often sick in high school, and very good at ignoring it. The pain got worse. It was winter, and the sun was setting by four o’clock by the time I went to prep sound for the after-school theater production.  The pain got worse. It was never sharp, but a radiating flat hurt from the abdomen. The lights were too bright and I couldn’t sit up. I lowered myself to the floor and hoped it would pass. A friend came and held my hand and told me to call my mother. She says she’ll be half an hour. I leave the theater. It is night now. I alone below a barrel cactus in the median of the parking lot and I realize I am dying. Fourth five minutes pass and I call my mother crying. She says half an hour. I cry. <br>
She’s unhappy she’s had to pick me up. I don’t really care. She tells me to stop crying and gives me a Tylenol. At home, I take 3 and lie in delirious pain. At two in the morning, I beg her to drive me to the hospital. A clock, a needle in the vein. The surgeon arrives at six to cut my body open. I wake up and have a panic attack and my mother laughs at me. <br>
My sister picked me up from surgery in her filter flavored car, always clean with five or six cardboard freshener trees dangling from the mirror. She puts on Mac DeMarco and we make plans to go to LA to see him live. <br>
She won’t let me drive her car at all, even though the LA driving is making her cry. I walk to the Griffith park and watch teenagers jump the fences into the abandoned animal enclosures and she watches TikTok videos on the couch of the air BnB. I walk home and a short old man with a thick accent asks me out for coffee. I don’t know how to handle this. I give him a ten dollar bill and then sprint down the street. <br>
The watcher was raised in a different time. The watcher was raised on stories of chivalry and trauma experiences in reality. The watcher was raised being told to be strong. She is cruel but she is not cold. <br>
My parents were cold to us children, sometimes cruel. They were a deeply unhappy pairing where most days ended in a screaming match and throwing things and broken dishes. I was always least favorite, for I was troubled in a way they couldn’t quite comprehend. They took me to nurse practitioners and therapists and my mind went blank with panic until I could find the chance to run out down the street and hide below Eucalyptus barriers until inevitably spotted by a nurse or police officer. She called the cops on me. I got handcuffed and somehow subjected to a playlist of her design. I remember being warm, all the way to the hospital. <br><br>
I brought my cat with me and passersby are in awe. It’s unexpected to see a cat out, especially a cat on a leash. This cat is not altogether well behaved, tied to a bench beside me, throwing her body up in the air and ducking her head down with the airs of a creature trying to slip a collar. Thank god the harness is holding, at least for now. <br>
Dogs always walk easy on the end of a lead. When you say go, the dog goes, happy in motion and sights. When you say stop, the dog stops, equally happy to lay in rest. <br>
The cat has resigned herself to the position stillness, sunning in the dirt and gazing quick up at the fiches come to their winter roosts along the sides of the streambed. At one time, great amounts of water poured from a craig in the earth to feed it, enough for several villages oasising between stretches of cactus, enough to feed five or six shallow lakes and a couple dozen mesquite groves, branch arms interlocked, canopy shading against the noontime. <br>
Around 1950, some ranchers, dissatisfied with this output, packed the spring with dynamite, believing that lighting it would lead the stream to flow higher. They lit the fuse and ran. Where there was once a shallow hillside, there was a collapsing pit. They looked down. No torrent of water danced from the earth. In fact, there was hardly any water at all. What had been a healthy stream three minutes ago had been reduced to hardly a trickle. <br>
Maybe it takes time, they said at each other other, gritting teeth. So they waited a day and a week and then they dug at it with shovels and placed five or six more charges. But the creek would never be more than a trickle again.  <br>
I keep forgetting she’s in grief. I’m a really bad listener. I’m kind of awful in so many ways and I’ve kind of given up on everything. Selfishness comes so naturally, as always. And I have no idea how to help. I’ve never felt grief before, not like that. <br>
People are here, and then they are gone. There is a young family at the lakeside, all three dressed in flannel and kaki. The child sits between them, sneezing and grabbing dirt. He is swung, laughing, onto his father’s shoulders and gasps in wonder when he notices the cat. <br>
Grief has always been a sort-of non-thing to me. Living implies the certainty of death and I keep this knowledge close to my heart. Every moment of existing is a gift, no matter should it be in pain or pleasure. When someone close to me dies, I feel, just for a few moments that absolute pain of loss. And when it is no longer pure, when it has become muddied by practicalities or self pity, I simply release it. For I am interested only in pain as beauty. Complete obsidian, in sharpness, in depth of color. <br>
What I seek is absolute being. The simple act of experience. I spent many years of my life trying to escape being. The way I was living was painful to me, and so I sought by any means to escape it. Mostly dissociation. <br>
Original sin has a point. We are born into pain. We are born into misery and inequity and the great instability of life and death. The Australian birthday song begs the question- would it have been better if we were not born at all? <br>
The cat now, although tethered, has encouraged me, through several minutes of complaining to move under into the crunch of leaves under a couple small cottonwoods and short wintering willows. Up and down over a short log, ducking between the tangles of branches, at last her play has come to a rest between tufts of leaves and grass. She gazes, calm interest, at the lake and reeds and the rustle of trees. A flock of snow-white sparrows patter rushing wings over the crown branches above her. She watches with the mild interest of the well fed body, and then returns to taciturn contemplation of the shore. <br>
So much of life comes beautifully, when you let it. Contentment takes no high paying job, no high powered car.  Rather, it is the being cared for, it is the being well fed. To find contentment is to be of the mind of the well fed cat. <br>
For indeed, the cat can find fulfilment anywhere. Solitary or finch shocked, the cat of the office or the home reclines in perfect leisure, the barn cat raises herself near wild, curled into purpose of survival, and yet lays all the same soft playfulness in the winter warmth of straw. <br>
We are domesticated creatures, all of us western people, in our grocery store aisles and pavement parks, in our bathtubs and insulated rooftops. And yet, so easily comes the forgetting of domestication. How often we forget the simple miracle of turning on electric lights, the miracle of having shelter at all. <br>
Pleasure is not complicated. Pleasure is pure and simple, always. It is the warmth of blanket and hearth, it is cold sandwiches and the delight in watching the sweeping and the birds. <br>
A couple gets into a fight in the parking lot over something they can’t find, but it’s over nearly as it’s begun. They come to marvel over the cat, and then move through the squat old orchard that’s turning over green into orange-ripe globes, fresh fruit that hasn’t yet ripened to the flies and sparrow-mouths. <br>
Look how pretty these flowers are, a mother points out to her child, who is skipping, running down the walk. Look at the turtles, says the mother in amazement. For indeed, it is a fantastic thing to see the turtles sunning on their logs. <br>
It is midday. And all is well. <br><br><br>

  It’s supposed to be our heart, not beating but whirring, a computer server or an arsonist, flicking the match, igniting, roaring to life. We know neither biology nor mechanics, but anyway, we are alive. Down the street, metal and bone, scraping against the curb sharp and sharp breath. What, what, what we’ve done- we’ve discovered a lost city in the jungle. That’s our claim to fame, revving engines and gunshots and the smell of chemicals off another housefire. We have opinions in the crosshairs of police cars, white cars with white decals trying to get us to race down Valencia. We ignore them. No, we don’t. We roll our window down and say- “Go home, follow the doctor or the lawyer who never makes the bed, start going to the gym, start pulling up the blinds and drinking at home. Become the kind of person who looks into the sky and finds nothing but endless darkness or endless light.” Someone else takes up the offer. Man in a jeep, man with a bad moustache, man with a white-painted girl leaning her head on his passenger side. Red light, green light, red and blue and sirens. She leaves streaks of eyelash glue on the tinted glass. <br>
In the morning, we have a parking ticket, a dead battery and unchanged oil, rolling hand and knee down the hill ‘til our ignition combusts to life. Sometimes, we find roaches in our fuse box. Dried out, leave them out for someone else’s tires to crush. We can’t look away. It’s another rollover, another rainy day that skids and coats the asphalt in plastic bumper, like that time we went eighty down that nowhere road and slipped into the ditch, easy as diving into the shallow end of a swimming pool. <br>

Under construction: a monument to us. An American flag. dirty oil running down our riverbed, everything all heavy with daisies and skinny goats. Rust and rust-away, deer-hair, stunned, angry, stuck in our windshield. What happened? Are you okay? The deer staggers off to die in the darkness. Oh god. We pull ourselves out of it. Oh god. <br><br><br><br>

  To love is to be loved. I am alone in a field, somewhere with no hunting pictographs I can’t read. In the café I collect my thoughts on a hairpin and leave them behind, shoved in the power outlet. I didn’t know it at the time, but someone without a face is selling a car in California. <br>
Everyone is flocking to New England to take care of elderly relatives. Winter is on the doorstep. <br>
Every day I cut a piece or five of my hair and leave it in a plastic bag in the sink. I record it so it counts as performance art. <br>
My professor has youtube algorithm taste. I also have youtube algorithm taste. Once, when I was on hard drugs, I became convinced that all music on youtube was notjust algorithmically served, but algorithmically generated. It might be. Who knows. <br>

EARLY AFTERNOON THOUGHTS <br>
I think I’m playing a character, one I’ve already created, short shorts and a dolly Parton wig, talking about getting impaled by the door opener. I try to go to an experimental art show in someone’s house but when I get to the building a cat gives me a weird look so I spin on my heel and walk back home. I think it’s a boring story, really. That’s the heart of it. All I care about is the land and the freeway. I don’t care about the car or the horses or the faggot boyfriend. I care about death mostly, but-<br>
He’s jaywalking, basketball shorts, backpack, bleach blonde crew cut, tattoo of a celebrity wife with her face rounded around the back of his calf muscle. She’s inside a bowling alley, on a zoom call, fading pale thin lips like a chevy fleetside; one-oh-ten chorme with a parking from last year crinkled on the window. Strike, all thirty screens proclaim-<br>
I love the US military. I can’t help it. It’s evil because it’s a military it’s full of people who have no choice but to think they are helping save the world. Offer your body, offer your mind. They will pay you a white picket camero and tell you it’s the right thing. You get a little cash, you a wife and a moral martyrdom. God bless the-<br>
I haven’t finished anything I set out to do today. I never finish anything I set out to do. I’m hungry, haven’t eaten anything in a week besides sex dreams and red kratom. Now im craving grease, yellow advertisements and diner fries-<br>
There’s an article about Ozempec in the Washington post. I get a thrill, something embodied, thinking about injecting myself with it. There’s something really wrong with me, a craving for Ozempic submission, sacrificing of the natural order of the flesh to medical devastation. I want to be held down, I want to be shot up. Controlled, molded medical Pygmalion, forced into snake stardom.  I want to be bones and naught else, withering 4 u-<br>

It is the 6am procession of our bodies, Carrie fisher clean, tight braids and running shoes beating down the twilight, brilliant disciplined minds of us future MD JD CIA specialists. And it is us coming down from LSDderall, gaunt ghosts aimless down the white stripe middle of the road, sitting in people’s front yards, in the half-hallucinating self-sabotage of world peace poetry. There are the tight-wound cops and kidnappers, looking though binoculars at McDonald’s coffee, classic rock, and cast iron aquariums. We are going, we are coming, we are waiting. <br>
Don’t go out at the end of the month, don’t spray paint walls or talk to addicts. The cops have quotas to meet, so leave your Monday mornings out of this <br>

“who is that boy?” I ask ToMary, gesturing to a creature in the soy field, long and pale, hands shaking, raised to the sun.  <br>
“Are you a hired hand?” she asks, without turning to me, “A psychology major twenty bucks an hour sipping tea in front of your glowing screen?” <br>
“I am, by the grace of god.” <br>
ToMary squints into the sun. “I’ve never seen him before. In the country to get sane.” <br>
“I’m sure the pesticides will do him a lot of good.” <br>
“You never know. The mind is mysterious” <br>

     The killer whale boatside rams it's head into the stern. Blood cracks flakes of plastic. There is no song.

Sun at the north half out. <br>

    The woman across the aisle is winding thread. She's embroidering a bag, a truly fantastic thing with stars going all the way down, branched trees, and a big sun with a snake in it. I embroider too, but not nearly as well, my stitches large and awkward, those of an unpracticed child. <br>
Her work is mesmerizing, twisting strands of gold into the fabric of the bag, spirals from the core of the snake. I drew a spiral on my wall. It was for defense reasons. Not that i believe in that. Or whatever. She wears a bright orange zip up coat, nearly florescent. She pricks her finger and jumps as the blood spreads through the fabric of the bag. <br>

jack<br>
daniels into a water bottle <br>
and hides it under his shirt when we walk in. He drives a shiny white car, low<br>
