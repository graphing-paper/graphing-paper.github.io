      TED KACYNSKI POEM (originally from character workshop class last week. edited later)<br><br>
      
    When I was a – a kid<br>
, all the movies I saw were on VHS, things my parents liked. Joe vs Volcano, Beaches, Princess Bride.<br>
peace and love, BABY<br>
hair black when I was a freshman in collage<br>
wanted to be uma therman, smoking cigarettes and<br>
I HAVE DOEN TONS OF DRUGS WITH YOU AND KEPT YOU ALIVE FOREVER!!!!” this my memorial 2<br>
TED KACYNSKI <br>
attaching a ifesto turned into a apocalypse prepper and built a compost bin in the yard without asking
me. He dropped out of school to do who knows what and then I had to H. at a freak. Fuck that guy. Fuck
Ted Kaczynski too.<br><br>

      

my hair get oily- slicked it back,. Women wouldn’t sleep with me<br>
though. Only men at parties, drunk and ag <br>
 second dates they <br>
brought me bottles of jack daniels on top of the fridge. nice to be wanted.<br><br>

jack<br>
daniels into a water bottle <br>
and hides it under his shirt when we walk in. He drives a shiny white car, low<br>
to the ground with really tinted windows. I thought it looked like a drug dealer’s car and when I told him<br>
this he got upset. I drink too much Jack Daniels and the final scene of the film gives me a <br>
panic<br>
 attack.<br><br>

      
      
 weird look, hair black. I go to a seedy motel<br>
 with a coworker. I<br>
see more movies with my new roommate until I scream at him <br>
media depictions of what a “cool” person should be, <br>
and the doubts she <br>

  V3 <br><br>
  
  the desert is silent but for the sounds of war <br>
  hobble to the crash. Blood and glass<br>
dry red OUCH WIRE<br>
NECK WIRE<br>
EYES GLAZED OVER<br>
backseat of the truck<br>
NECK WIRE<br>
Hits the ground<br>
NECK WIRE<br>

      V2
      
    The city ends. Suburban lots, dry red desert barbed wire fences dead grass as far as the eye can see. <br>
gas down as far as it will go, roaring sketched into the land,<br>
 rusting out all that drought. <br>
child in the backseat of the truck, <br>
neck pierced with wires,<br>
 eyes glazed over. <br>
The car swerves glass and metal shattering as it hits the ground the woman thrown through the front windshield. <br>
hot asphalt. <br>
from the shade of his sun-bleached RV, sun towards the road.<br>
OLD MAN<br>
  hobble to the crash. Blood and glass cover the road, the overturned truck.<br>
deformed and hissing climbs out of the shattered car window, expressionless. <br>
The old man stares<br>
 screams.<br>
 The wires on this neck blink red.<br>
 The child falls quiet. <br>
The old man blanket. <br>
