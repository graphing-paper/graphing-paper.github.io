 <p id="ohio"> really what captivated me about this album was that it claims to be "from cassette".
  it's actually one of the better peices of live looping music i've heard, but that's not really 
  saying much because most live looping music is really bad. i enjoy 
  the very natural progression from one "mood" to another, and it's a billion times better than
  any of the gross no effort "relaxation" music that seems to be everywhere nowadays. if you have a spa
  you should probably play this instead</p>
