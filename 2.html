 <p> really what captivated me about this album was that it claims to be "from cassette" but it's actually one of the better peices of live looping music i've heard. i really enjoy the very natural progression from one "mood" to another, and a billion times better than any of the gross corporate spa music that passes for ethereal nowadays</p>
